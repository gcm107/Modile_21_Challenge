# Module_21_Challenge

## Challenge: Martian Token Crowdsale

---

We will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive _**KASEI**_ , or KaseiCoin tokens.

* Symbol: KASEI
* Token Name: KaseCoin

## Technologies

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/) - MetaMask is a digital wallet for the Ethereum blockchain

_[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)_ - This is a programming language we use to create smart contracts.

_[Remix IDE website](https://remix.ethereum.org/)_ - This is where we build and test smart contracts that we create with Solidity.

[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) This program allows you to quickly and easily set up/test a local blockchain.

## Usage

Here are the steps:

1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain

After purchasing tokens with test accounts, view the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei that has been raised by the crowdsale. See the video below:
